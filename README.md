**GPA Calculator** is a project which requires a few parameters, such as Grade and Credit Hours to find the GPA for a particular semester of a person.
It was built using Python and the Gui Module/Library for Python called Tkinter.

**Procedure:**
1. Make the formula by reversing the GPA based on last semesters.
2. Write the code on a temporary basis, using GUI elements.
3. Add some UI elements.

**Formula:** 
((GPA per subject * credit for that subject)ADD that for each subject/Total Credits)

This project was made in collaboration with 3 other colleagues.

**NOTE : Our college has gradation point criteria system out of 4.**
